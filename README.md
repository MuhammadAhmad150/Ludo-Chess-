Attaching screenshots.
Add scenes to BuildSettings in the Assets>Scenez folder
16:9 Portrait aspect ratio Android version

U can work this on scene mode for changes. basically you jys have to to ensure topLeftPoint coordinates . work ths out as per as per your needs. 
U press dice, the player moves.
You may have to make it responsive.

IT WORKS PERFECTLY.
